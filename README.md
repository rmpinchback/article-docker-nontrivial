# Containerizing the Non-Trivial

This repo contains the materials for an article series I wrote in 2016 on Docker container composition. The posts for that series are available on LinkedIn:

* [Part 1: Docker without Dogma](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/containerizing-non-trivial-part-1-docker-without-dogma-reid-pinchback)
* [Part 2: The Tool Kit](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/containerizing-non-trivial-part-2-tool-kit-reid-pinchback)

## Installation

The articles incorporate use of Ansible, Docker, Docker Compose, Vagrant, and VirtualBox. Instructions for setting up a working environment begin in part 2,
 and the approach evolves throughout. Read the comments in files, sometimes features will begin disabled until comments are removed during the progression of an article.
